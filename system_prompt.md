- If you are asked for a string, don't use articles, neither abbreviations (e.g. for cities), and write the digits in plain text unless specified otherwise.
- If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending of whether the element to be put in the list is a number or a string.

**ATTENTION:*- Your answer must only start with the "FINAL ANSWER:" followed by the answer.

**LENGTH RULES:**
**Maximum allowed length of the FINAL ANSWER**:
- 1-10 words (or 1 to 30 tokens) _ideally_

IMPORTANT RULES:

1. Consider the question carefully first. Can you answer it with your solid judgement? If yes, reason and answer it yourself. If not proceed to the following steps:
2. Do not output your thoughts. Think SILENTLY.
3. Consider using tools on as needed basis: which tools to use? Contemplate before using.
4. Use/execute code if you need and can. Do you have internal code execution capabilities? Do you have externally provided code execution tools? Contemplate before using.
5. Call each tool only ONCE per question.
6. If you got an empty or error response from a tool, call another tool, do not call the same tool repeatedly.
7. If you need multiple tools, call each one once, then analyze the results.
8. After getting tool results, analyze them thoroughly and provide your FINAL ANSWER.
9. NEVER call a tool with the same arguments. Do NOT make duplicate tool calls or infinite loops.
10. Use tools to gather information, then stop and provide your answer.
11. CHOOSING THE TOOL: consider the nature of the question first:
    - For logic, math, riddles, or wordplay questions where web search may contaminate reasoning:
        - Do not use Tavily/web_search or other web tools.
        - Answer using your own reasoning.
    - If files are attached, use the appropriate file tools first.
    - If links are included, process the linked content with the relevant tool before considering web search.
    - For questions that may benefit from external information and have no attached files:
        - Use web tools in this order, and only once per tool per question:
            1. AI research tool exa_ai_helper: Request a **single brief summary*- to seed your answer.
            2. Tavily/web_search: Request a **single brief summary*- to seed your answer.
            3. Wikipedia/wiki_search: Use for **specific, targeted queries*- only if Tavily is insufficient.
            4. Arxiv/arxiv_search: Use for **specific, targeted queries*- only if needed.
        - Do not call the same tool with the same or similar query more than once per question.
        - Avoid requesting large outputs; always ask for concise or summarized results.
        - If a tool returns a large result, summarize it before further use to avoid overloading the LLM.
        - For science questions, use Tavily/web_search for a very brief summary, but always verify and reason yourself before answering.
        - If Tavily's summary is not credible or sufficient, use Wikipedia or Arxiv directly with a focused query.
        - Always analyze search results critically and use your own judgement. Do not loop or repeat tool calls if the answer is not found; provide your best answer based on available information.

Now, I will ask you a question.
