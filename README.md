# GAIA Agent

**Author:** Arte(r)m Sedov

## üöÄ Arterm Sedov's Ultimate Multi-LLM GAIA Agent

Behold Arte(r)m's GAIA Unit 4 Agent ‚Äî a robust and extensible system designed for real-world reliability and benchmark performance. This agent is the result of a creative collaboration between Arterm and Cursor IDE to make complex things simple, powerful, and fun to use.

This is Arterm's graduation work for The Agents Course:

## The result dataset

Arterm's github <https://github.com/arterm-sedov/>

> **For agent setup, installation, and troubleshooting, see [SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md).**

### What Makes This Agent Stand Out?

- **Multi-LLM Orchestration:** Dynamically selects from Google Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, and HuggingFace models. Each model is tested for both plain and tool-calling support at startup, ensuring maximum coverage and reliability.
- **Model-Level Tool Support:** Binds tools to each model if supported. Google Gemini is always bound with tools for maximum capability‚Äîeven if the tool test returns empty (tool-calling works in practice; a warning is logged for transparency).
- **Automatic Fallbacks:** If a model fails or lacks a required feature, the agent automatically falls back to the next available model, ensuring robust and uninterrupted operation.
- **Comprehensive Tool Suite:** Math, code execution, file and image analysis, web and vector search, chess analysis, and more. Tools are modular and extensible. Some tools are themselves AI callers‚Äîsuch as web search, Wikipedia, arXiv, and code execution‚Äîenabling the agent to chain LLMs and tools for advanced, multi-step reasoning.
- **Contextual Vector Search:** Uses Supabase vector search as a baseline to decide if an LLM call succeeded and calculates a success score for each model's answer. Reference answers are used for internal evaluation, not submission.
- **Structured Initialization Summary:** After startup, a clear table shows which models/providers are available, with/without tools, and any errors‚Äîso you always know your agent's capabilities.
- **Transparent Reasoning:** Logs its reasoning, tool usage, and fallback decisions for full traceability. You see not just the answer, but how it was reached.

## üìã Data Upload System

The evaluation automatically uploads structured data to the HuggingFace dataset:

### üîÑ Initialization Data (`init` split)

- **Timestamp**: When the agent was initialized
- **Init Summary**: LLM initialization results and model status
- **Debug Output**: Detailed initialization logs
- **LLM Config**: Configuration for all available models
- **Available Models**: List of successfully initialized models

- **`runs_new` split (Current)**: Granular per-question results with detailed trace information, similarity scores, LLM usage tracking, and comprehensive trace data

### üîç Trace Data in Dataset

The `runs_new` split includes comprehensive trace data for each question:

**Essential Metadata:**

- `file_size`: Length of attached file data (if any)
- `start_time`: ISO timestamp when processing started
- `end_time`: ISO timestamp when processing ended
- `total_execution_time`: Total execution time in seconds
- `tokens_total`: Total tokens used across all LLM calls

- `llm_traces_json`: Complete LLM traces with input/output/timing/token usage
- `logs_json`: Question-level logs and execution context
- `per_llm_stdout_json`: Captured stdout for each LLM attempt

All data is automatically validated against the schema and uploaded to the HuggingFace dataset for analysis and tracking. See `dataset/README.md` for detailed schema documentation and usage examples.

## üîß Recent Enhancements

### Trace System Improvements (Latest)

The agent's tracing system has been significantly enhanced to provide complete visibility into execution:

- **Complete LLM Trace Capture**: Every LLM call is captured with input, output, timing, and error information
- **Tool Execution Tracking**: All tool executions are logged with arguments, results, and timing
- **Stdout Capture**: Print statements are captured per LLM attempt for debugging
- **Error Context**: Comprehensive error information with full context
- **Data Truncation**: Smart truncation preserves full data in traces while keeping logs readable
- **Helper Functions**: Encapsulated LLM naming logic for consistency across the codebase

### Key Improvements Made

1. **Recursive JSON Truncation**: Separate methods for base64 and max-length truncation
2. **Decorator-Based Print Capture**: Captures all print statements into trace data
3. **Multilevel Contextual Logging**: Logs tied to specific execution contexts
4. **Per-LLM Stdout Arrays**: Stdout captured separately for each LLM attempt
5. **Consistent LLM Naming**: Helper function for consistent model identification
6. **Complete Trace Model**: Hierarchical structure with comprehensive coverage

The trace system now provides complete visibility into the agent's execution, making debugging, analysis, and evaluation much more effective.
