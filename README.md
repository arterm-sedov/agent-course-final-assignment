## üöÄ Arterm Sedov's Ultimate Multi-LLM GAIA Agent

Behold the GAIA Unit 4 Agent by Arte(r)m Sedov ‚Äî a robust and extensible system designed for real-world reliability and benchmark performance.

This project represents what I learned at HuggingFace Agents Course, eg. to build sophisticated AI agents.

This is Arterm's graduation work for The [Agents Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/en/).

## The results dataset

Running this agent takes a lot of time due to it complex reasoning and deep research nature.

See previous run details in the dataset:

<https://huggingface.co/datasets/arterm-sedov/agent-course-final-assignment>

## The agent to play with

> [!NOTE]
> The interesting things happen in the **Logs** section in the **HuggingFace space** while the evaluation runs.
> The agent works under the hood so you can only see its behavior in the logs.
> To skip the wait, see some of the previous at the **Log files** tab.
> The log files are more linear but less structured than the dataset above.

## üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What is this project?

This is an **experimental multi-LLM agent** that demonstrates advanced AI agent capabilities. 

I have developed the project to explore and showcase:

- **Input**: HuggingFace supplies curated GAIA questions and optional file attachments
- **Task**: Create an agent that gets a score of at least 30% on the GAIA questions
- **Challenge**: Process complex queries requiring multi-step reasoning, tool usage, and external data access
- **Solution**: Use multiple LLM providers with intelligent fallback and tool orchestration
- **Results**: The agent can get up to 80% score depending on the available LLMs. Typically it gets 50-65% score because I often 
run out of inference limits

## üéØ Project Goals

- **Multi-LLM Orchestration**: Intelligent sequencing through multiple LLM providers (OpenRouter, Google Gemini, Groq, HuggingFace)
- **Comprehensive Tool Suite**: Math, code execution, AI research, AI video & audio analysis, web search, file analysis, image processing, chess analysis, and more
- **Robust Fallback System**: Automatic retry and switching with different LLMs when one fails
- **Transparency**: Detailed structured execution traces and logs for every question processed (datasets and human-readable)
- **Reliability**: Rate limiting, error handling, and graceful degradation

## ‚ùì Why This Project?

This experimental system is based on current AI agent technology and demonstrates:

- **Advanced Tool Usage**: Seamless integration of 20+ specialized tools including AI-powered tools and third-party AI engines
- **Multi-Provider Resilience**: Automatic testing and switching between different LLM providers
- **Comprehensive Tracing**: Complete visibility into the agent's decision-making process
- **Real-World Performance**: Designed for actual benchmark evaluation scenarios, balancing speed, accuracy, logging verbosity and cost across multiple models
- **Contextual Vector Search:** Uses Supabase vector search as a baseline to decide if an LLM call succeeded and calculates a
success score for each model's answer. Reference answers are used for internal evaluation, not submission.
- **Structured Initialization Summary:** After startup, a clear table shows which models/providers are available, with/without
tools, and any errors‚Äîso you always know your agent's capabilities.

    "error": str                    # Error message (if any)
}
```

## Key Features

### Intelligent Fallback System

The agent automatically tries multiple LLM providers in sequence:

- **OpenRouter** (Primary): Fast, reliable, good tool support, has tight daily limits on free tiers
- **Google Gemini** (Fallback): High token limits, excellent reasoning
- **Groq** (Second Fallback): Fast inference, good for simple tasks, has tight token limits per request
- **HuggingFace** (Final Fallback): Local models, no API costs, does not support tools typically

### Advanced Tool Management

- **Automatic Tool Selection**: LLM chooses appropriate tools based on question
- **Tool Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate tool calls using vector similarity
- **Usage Limits**: Prevents excessive tool usage (e.g., max 3 web searches per question)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when tools fail

### Sophisticated implementations

- **Recursive Truncation**: Separate methods for base64 and max-length truncation
- **Recursive JSON Serialization**: Ensures the complex objects ar passable as HuggingFace JSON dataset
- **Decorator-Based Print Capture**: Captures all print statements into trace data
- **Multilevel Contextual Logging**: Logs tied to specific execution contexts
- **Per-LLM Stdout Traces**: Stdout captured separately for each LLM attempt in a human-readable form
- **Consistent LLM Schema**: Data structures for consistent model identification, configuring and calling
- **Complete Trace Model**: Hierarchical structure with comprehensive coverage
- **Structured dataset uploads** to HuggingFace datasets
- **Schema validation** against `dataset_config.json`
- **Three data splits**: `init` (initialization), `runs` (legacy aggregated results), and `runs_new` (granular per-question results)
- **Robust error handling** with fallback mechanisms

### Comprehensive Tracing

Every question generates a complete execution trace including:

- **LLM Interactions**: All input/output for each LLM attempt
- **Tool Executions**: Detailed logs of every tool call
- **Performance Metrics**: Token usage, execution times, success rates
- **Error Information**: Complete error context and fallback decisions
- **Stdout Capture**: All debug output from each LLM attempt

### Rate Limiting & Reliability

- **Smart Rate Limiting**: Different intervals for different providers
- **Token Management**: Automatic truncation and summarization
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry with different LLMs
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues processing even if some components fail

## Usage

### Live Demo

Visit the Gradio interface to test the agent interactively:

<https://huggingface.co/spaces/arterm-sedov/agent-course-final-assignment>

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from agent import GaiaAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = GaiaAgent()

# Process a question
result = agent("What is the capital of France?")

# Access the results
print(f"Answer: {result['submitted_answer']}")
print(f"Similarity: {result['similarity_score']}")
print(f"LLM Used: {result['llm_used']}")
```

### Dataset Access

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the dataset
dataset = load_dataset("arterm-sedov/agent-course-final-assignment")

# Access initialization data
init_data = dataset["init"]["train"]

# Access evaluation results
runs_data = dataset["runs_new"]["train"]
```

## File Structure

The main agent runtime files are:

```
gaia-agent/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agent.py              # Main agent implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                # Gradio web interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools.py              # Tool definitions and implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.py              # Core upload functions with validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system_prompt.json    # System prompt configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/               # Execution logs and results
```

There are other files in the root directory, but they are not used at the runtime, rather for setting up the Supabase vector store.

## Performance Statistics

The agent has been evaluated on complex benchmark questions with the following results:

- **Overall Success Rate**: 50-65%, up to 80% with all four LLMs available
- **Tool Usage**: Average 2-8 tools per question
- **LLM Fallback Rate**: 20-40% of questions require multiple LLMs
- **Response Time**: 30-120 seconds per question
- **Token Usage**: 1K-100K tokens per question (depending on complexity)
